# professor-search

## Overview
Find in-depth information about the professors at Clemson University including research statistics, visualized grade distributions, and the classes they teach. This web app was built with the Angular web framework and d3.js, and data was sourced from Clemson University Archives and Scopus.

## Prototype
A working example will be permanently available at [clemsonprofessors.web.app](https://clemsonprofessors.web.app/), however the data used is from Fall 2019 so newer professors are not in the database.
